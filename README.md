# VendingMachine
This Java program implements a simple vending machine GUI using Swing. Users can select products like Coca Cola, Pepsi, etc., add coins to make purchases, and get change if there's any balance left. The GUI updates the balance and displays the selected products in a cart. It's a basic simulation of a vending machine interface for learning purposes.
